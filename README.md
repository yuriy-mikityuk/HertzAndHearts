# Hertz & Hearts

Desktop HRV biofeedback app for ECG chest straps.
Current beta: **1.0.0-beta.2**.

**Research use only. Not for clinical diagnosis or treatment.**

## Start Here

- Recommended for most users (Windows/macOS/Linux):
  - Download a prebuilt package from Releases:
    - https://github.com/JoelAtHome/HertzAndHearts/releases
- Install from source (all platforms):
  - `python -m pip install .`
- Launch:
  - Windows: `py -3 -m hnh.app` (or `python -m hnh.app`)
  - macOS/Linux: `python3 -m hnh.app` (or `hnh` if on PATH)
- Pair your sensor in OS Bluetooth settings, then in-app:
  - `Scan` -> select sensor -> `Connect`
- Start a session:
  - `Start New` -> record -> `Stop & Save`

For full walkthrough:
- `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`

For troubleshooting:
- `docs/troubleshooting.md`

## Meditation workflow in this fork

Use **Meditation…** above the plots for a timed before / practice / after
protocol and a session diary. **Meditation history** compares fixed five-minute
RR metrics within matching conditions, with per-session or weekly trends.
Original RR intervals and correction flags are retained for later reanalysis.
See [the meditation guide](docs/MEDITATION.md) for setup, quality rules, exports
and interpretation. For source development, use Python 3.11.

## Downloads

- Prebuilt artifacts are published in GitHub Releases:
  - https://github.com/JoelAtHome/HertzAndHearts/releases

## Phone Bridge (Android, optional)

Most users can connect the strap directly with **PC BLE**. **Phone Bridge** is optional, but it can be much more stable when your computer’s Bluetooth stack struggles (scan failures, frequent disconnects, choppy streaming). In that setup your **phone** keeps the BLE link to the strap and forwards live data to Hertz & Hearts on the PC over **Wi‑Fi** (same LAN as the PC).

**Download and install the bridge app**

1. Open **Releases** (same page as the desktop downloads):
   https://github.com/JoelAtHome/HertzAndHearts/releases
2. On the release you are using, download **`PolarH10Bridge-debug-<tag>.apk`** (debug build of the Polar H10-to-PC bridge app).
3. Copy the APK to your Android phone (USB, cloud storage, etc.).
4. On the phone, allow installation from your file manager or browser if prompted (“unknown apps”), then open the APK and install.

If you need a build from **`main`** that is not on a release yet, use **Actions** → workflow **`android-bridge`** → artifact **`PolarH10Bridge-debug-apk`** (`app-debug.apk` inside the zip):
https://github.com/JoelAtHome/HertzAndHearts/actions/workflows/android-bridge.yml

**Use it with Hertz & Hearts**

- In Hertz & Hearts, set **Connection Mode** to **Phone Bridge**, enter your **phone’s Wi‑Fi IP address** and port (**8765** by default), then **Connect**. The bridge app shows the address to use (your numbers will differ from any screenshot).
- Full walkthrough, permissions (Bluetooth, location for BLE scan), and troubleshooting: **`docs/PHONE_BRIDGE_QUICKSTART.md`**.
